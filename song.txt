Smooth like butter, like a criminal undercover
Gon' pop like trouble breaking into your heart like that (ooh)
Cool shade, stunner, yeah, I owe it all to my mother
Hot like summer, yeah, I'm making you sweat like that (break it down)
Ooh, when I look in the mirror
I'll melt your heart into two
I got that superstar glow, so
Ooh (do the boogie, like)
Side step, right-left, to my beat
High like the moon, rock with me, baby
Know that I got that heat
Let me show you 'cause talk is cheap
Side step, right-left, to my beat
Get it, let it roll
